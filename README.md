# Wind-Turbine-Failure-Analysis-
This project analyzes operational wind turbine data to detect early failure patterns and improve turbine efficiency. The goal is to transform raw sensor data into actionable insights that can help reduce downtime and enable predictive maintenance.

What This Project Covers
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on temperature, wind speed, rotor speed, and power output
Statistical analysis including variance, skewness, and kurtosis
Outlier detection and treatment using visual methods and Winsorization
Power BI dashboard for interactive insights

 Key Insights from the Analysis
High generator and gearbox temperatures correlate with turbine failure.
Misalignment in yaw angle affects power generation efficiency.
Detecting abnormal power output patterns helps predict future failures.

 Tech Stack Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Power BI: Dashboard for visual analytics
Dataset: 26,282 rows, 16 columns with turbine performance parameters

 Outcome
The analysis helps identify patterns that indicate operational issues before failure occurs. This approach supports:
Predictive maintenance
Increased operational efficiency
Reduced turbine downtime

 Future Improvements
Implement machine learning models for early failure prediction
Deploy dashboard solutions for real-time monitoring

Deploy dashboard solutions for real-time monitoring
(Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn) and MySQL, the dataset is cleaned, visualized, and evaluated for abnormal temperature and power output trends to support predictive maintenance.
